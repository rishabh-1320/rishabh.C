                Arksaber is a whitelabel design system I built end to end — designed in Figma, then built as real React and Tailwind components, themeable across brands.

                Most design systems stop at Figma and hand off a spec. This one ships as code. Same components, same token names — swap the values, and the whole system re-skins for a new brand.

                <p className="content-prose">
                  I kept hitting the same gap. Design systems live in Figma. Products live in code. And the space between them is where consistency quietly dies — values get re-typed, states get missed, the build drifts from the design.
                </p>
                <p className="content-prose mt-4">
                  So I set a constraint: don&apos;t call it done at handoff. Call it done when it runs.
                </p>
                <p className="content-prose mt-4">
                  Arksaber was my way to prove I could own the whole loop — design the system, define the tokens, and build the actual components — and keep the two in lockstep. Whitelabel made it harder on purpose: if the architecture is right, one system should dress up as many brands without touching a single component.
                </p>
              </CaseSection>

              <Divider />

              <CaseSection id="tokens" heading="The architecture: tokens that name themselves">
                <p className="content-prose">
                  The system rests on tokens, and the naming is doing the heavy lifting.
                </p>
                <p className="content-prose mt-4">
                  Every token reads as <InlineCode>component / variant / property / state</InlineCode>. So <InlineCode>button/primary/fill/resting</InlineCode> is the fill color of a primary button at rest. <InlineCode>button/secondary/content/disabled</InlineCode> is the text color of a disabled secondary button. You can read a token and know exactly where it lives.
                </p>
                <p className="content-prose mt-4">A few real ones:</p>
                <ul className="mt-3 list-disc space-y-2 pl-5 text-[14px] leading-7 font-mono text-ds-ink-soft marker:text-ds-ink-muted">
                  <li>button/primary/fill/resting → #3b82f6</li>
                  <li>button/primary/fill/hover → #2563eb</li>
                  <li>button/secondary/content/resting → #2563eb</li>
                  <li>button/secondary/outline/resting → #e5e5e5</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="content-prose mt-4">
                  It&apos;s not just color. Spacing and type are tokenized too — <InlineCode>spacing/button/gap</InlineCode> (8px), <InlineCode>size/label-md</InlineCode> (14px), <InlineCode>family/label-md</InlineCode> (Inter). Nothing in a component is a magic number; everything points back to a named decision.

                />
                <p className="content-prose mt-4">
                  <strong>Why this matters:</strong> this is the layer that makes whitelabel work. The component never hard-codes a color. It asks for a token. So re-skinning a brand isn&apos;t a redesign — it&apos;s a new set of values behind the same names.
                </p>

                <p className="content-prose mt-4">
                  Because every component pulls from tokens, theming a second brand means changing the token <em>values</em> — not the components. The button doesn&apos;t know what brand it&apos;s in. It just knows it needs <InlineCode>button/primary/fill/resting</InlineCode>, whatever that resolves to.
                </p>
                <p className="content-prose mt-4">
                  That&apos;s the whole trick, and it&apos;s why the naming had to be disciplined first. Get the token layer right, and theming becomes a config change instead of a rebuild.

                  I fed it two things: my token definitions as JSON, and the Figma designs themselves through Figma&apos;s MCP. From there, AI generated the CSS tokens and wrote the React components to match the designs — variant by variant, state by state.
