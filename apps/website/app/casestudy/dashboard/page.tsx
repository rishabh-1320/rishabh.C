                Timelabs is an HRMS used by large enterprises. Its admin dashboard showed plenty of data but didn&apos;t help anyone decide anything. I redesigned it into an attendance and workforce analytics dashboard that surfaces patterns, not just numbers — when people actually show up, who&apos;s likely to take leave when, and how the workforce breaks down across departments, shifts, and branches.
              </p>
              <p className="content-prose">
                It shipped. Leaders use it. And the interesting part wasn&apos;t the charts — it was figuring out which numbers mattered, how to show them, and getting them to actually work in code.

                  Timelabs already had an admin dashboard. The data was all there — comprehensive, technically complete. But it was a wall of numbers. Leaders had to sit with it and do the analysis themselves. Nobody opens a dashboard to do homework.
                </p>
                <p className="content-prose mt-4">
                  The company wanted a redesign that did the thinking for the leader. Open it, see what&apos;s happening with your workforce, decide something.

                <p className="content-prose">
                  Honest framing: there was no user research on this project. No interviews, no workshops, no card sorting. It was requirements-driven — the CEO, CTO, and PMs knew the HRMS space and brought a list of what they wanted.
                </p>
                <p className="content-prose mt-4">
                  So my evidence base was different. When we disagreed on what a KPI should be or how to show it, we&apos;d look at how comparable products solved it, search for conventions, and pressure-test the logic. Competitive analysis instead of user testing.
                </p>
                <p className="content-prose mt-4">
                  The CEO was the hardest to align with — not because he was wrong, but because he kept changing his mind. We revisited KPIs multiple times before landing on each one.
                </p>
                <p className="content-prose mt-4">
                  Here&apos;s the thing about attendance: people don&apos;t follow their shift times. They have their own rhythms. The real job of this dashboard was to surface those hidden patterns — the gap between the schedule and reality. The CEO pushed for this and he was right to.

                  The brief was &ldquo;show everything useful.&rdquo; So the initial KPI list was huge — every attendance, workforce, device, and demographic metric you could think of.
                </p>
                <p className="content-prose mt-4">
                  That&apos;s a trap. A dashboard that shows everything helps with nothing. The real work was filtering: which numbers drive a decision, and which are just noise dressed up as insight.
                </p>
                <p className="content-prose mt-4">
                  I narrowed it through iteration — putting KPIs in, seeing if they earned their place, cutting the ones that didn&apos;t. No formal framework. Trial, error, and judgment.

                <p className="content-prose">
                  Once I knew what to show, the question became how. A few decisions worth calling out:

                  <SubCard title="Attendance Trends → a dot plot">
                    <p className="content-prose">
                      Instead of a single arrival time or a simple bar, I plotted every employee&apos;s arrival as a dot, grouped by department, across the morning hours. Now you can see the <em>spread</em> — which departments cluster early, which trickle in, where the late tail sits. That&apos;s the pattern the CEO wanted. A bar chart would&apos;ve flattened it into an average and hidden the truth.

                  <SubCard title="Head Count → a table, not a pie">
                    <p className="content-prose">
                      The obvious choice for &ldquo;employees per branch&rdquo; is a pie chart. But this dashboard was built for large enterprises — 15, 20+ departments and branches. A pie chart falls apart past 9 or 10 slices. So head count became a clean table with numbers you can actually read and compare.

                      Most of these KPIs weren&apos;t single numbers sitting in a database. They were combinations — multiple data points processed through SQL to produce one figure. The engineer kept hitting the same wall: which data points to mix, and how. So we worked through it together, KPI by KPI, defining exactly what each number was made of and what got it there.

                <p className="content-prose mt-4">
                  I caught it in QA, sat with the developer, and we fixed it: give each bar a minimum width and spacing, then let the chart scroll horizontally past the fold instead of cramming everything into view. The chart stays readable no matter how many departments you throw at it.
