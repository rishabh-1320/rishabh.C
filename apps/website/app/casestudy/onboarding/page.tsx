                Timelabs had a digital candidate onboarding flow. Almost nobody used it.

              <p className="content-prose mt-3">
                Candidates found it confusing, so HR ran onboarding manually — defeating the whole point of a digital flow. I rebuilt it into a clear, guided, self-service experience where candidates always know where they are, what&apos;s done, and what&apos;s next.

              <p className="content-prose mt-3">
                It shipped, and onboarding got faster. HR went from <em>doing</em> the work to <em>approving</em> it.

                  The onboarding flow already existed. It just didn&apos;t work as an experience.
                </p>
                <p className="content-prose mt-4">
                  It was built like an <strong>admin panel</strong> — tasks in tables, dense forms, manual document uploads. For a new hire on day one, it was confusing. They couldn&apos;t tell:
                </p>
                <ul className="mt-3 list-disc space-y-2 pl-5 text-[15px] leading-7 text-ds-ink-soft marker:text-ds-ink-muted">
                  <li>Where they were in the process</li>
                  <li>What was done</li>
                  <li>What was still pending</li>
                  <li>What to do next</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="content-prose mt-4">
                  So candidates avoided it. And when candidates don&apos;t self-serve, the work doesn&apos;t disappear — it lands on HR, who completed onboarding by hand for every new hire. A digital product that created manual work.
