                <strong>Chestnut is a producer performance management platform for the insurance world.</strong> It worked — but it was inconsistent and hard to use. The same action looked different on every screen, and simple things felt complicated.

                I audited the entire product, catalogued every inconsistency, and rebuilt it into one standardized system of components and patterns. Then I took it further: instead of handing developers Figma files, I built the design system in code.

                <p className="content-prose mt-4">
                  Those middlemen hire producers (agents) who sell the policies to real customers.

                  <strong>Chestnut is the software those middlemen use to manage their producers</strong> — tracking compliance, payouts, and performance. Day-to-day, it&apos;s used by admins and managers, not the agents themselves.

                <p className="content-prose mt-4">
                  The terminology — carriers, producers, IMOs — is the language the clients use. I had to learn it to design for it.

                  I rebuilt the core components from the ground up — <strong>buttons, tables, headers, and their states</strong> — plus the interaction patterns that tied them together. One source of truth for how Chestnut should look and behave.

                  <strong>Here&apos;s where I changed how I work.</strong>
                </p>
                <p className="content-prose mt-4">
                  Normally a designer hands off Figma files and hopes the build matches. I didn&apos;t want that gap. So instead of delivering the system in Figma, I built it in code.
                </p>
                <p className="content-prose mt-4">What that looked like:</p>
                <ul className="mt-3 list-disc space-y-2 pl-5 text-[15px] leading-7 text-ds-ink-soft marker:text-ds-ink-muted">
                  <li>Set up a <strong>Storybook</strong> to visualize every component</li>
                  <li>Built out a proper <strong>component library</strong></li>
                  <li>Chestnut&apos;s front-end was already <strong>shadcn-based</strong> — a head start, but the components weren&apos;t complete or built the way we needed</li>
                  <li>Modified them into Chestnut&apos;s own design system: <strong>Bonsai</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p className="content-prose mt-4">
                  Once Bonsai existed, I started delivering my designs in code instead of Figma.
                </p>
                <p className="content-prose mt-4">
                  <strong>This is where AI earns its place in my workflow.</strong> Prototyping and shipping in code used to be slow — in Figma you place every frame, component, and pixel by hand. With AI, I prompt and the agent builds. It&apos;s faster. And more importantly, it closes the gap between what I design and what ships. <strong>The design system stopped being a picture of components. It became the components.</strong>

                  Remember what Chestnut does: it works out what insurance producers get paid.

                <p className="content-prose mt-4">
                  Admins build that math as <strong>payment logic</strong> — a formula assembled from <strong>variables</strong>. A variable might be a policy field, a producer attribute, or a calculated value that combines several of them. Premium, agent code, policy year, a persistency rate — these are the building blocks of a payout.

                  So configuring payment logic is one of the highest-stakes things you can do in the product. <strong>Get it wrong and a producer gets paid the wrong amount — real money, at scale.</strong> The people doing it are admins who know the platform, the variables, and the insurance industry cold.

                  You&apos;re deep in building a payment logic. You reach for a variable — and it doesn&apos;t exist yet. Maybe it&apos;s a brand-new attribute. Maybe it&apos;s a value that combines several others.

                  When the stakes are this high, the admin shouldn&apos;t have to imagine the outcome — they should <strong>see it</strong>. So Step 4 ends in a live preview: apply the configuration, and Chestnut shows real producers (by NPN) with their actual persistency values.

                  I designed the entire flow — all four steps, every state.

                <p className="content-prose mt-4">
                  The <strong>analytic variable</strong> type itself was new. Engineering created it, and I was in from the start, designing the experience around it as it took shape. It worked well enough that it was later added to Settings too — the same creation flow, now living in both places.
                </p>
                <p className="content-prose mt-4">
                  I built on <strong>Bonsai</strong> (the design system from Part A) wherever I could, but this feature pushed past it. Several pieces had to be <strong>custom</strong>: the variable-type cards, the second set of radio selectors, and a few more — patterns Bonsai didn&apos;t have yet.
                </p>
                <p className="content-prose mt-4">
                  I worked closely with the <strong>Chestnut PM</strong> through design, then with the <strong>engineers</strong> through the build — largely making sure the design decisions survived into the shipped product.

                <p className="content-prose mt-4">
                  <strong>It shipped, and it&apos;s live.</strong> The full flow — the in-context trigger, the four steps, the preview — is in the product.

                  The dead end is gone. An admin who hits a missing variable no longer leaves, no longer loses their work, and no longer flies blind. They create exactly what they need, see it work, and keep going.
